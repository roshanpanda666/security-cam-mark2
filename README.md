# security-cam-mark2
here i have added terminal 
and set a password
and when a movement detects it will count
so imagine you are sleeping at night and your security cam plugd in infront of your house detects some movement 
in mark 1 you will never know if any movement detecs or not, it only create some beep sound
but now you will now know how many movent it detected
exp--> imagine 50 movements it detects all night 
so when you weakup in the morning you can see it detected 50 movements
